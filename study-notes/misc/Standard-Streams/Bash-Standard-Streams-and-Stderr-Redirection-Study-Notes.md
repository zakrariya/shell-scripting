# Bash Standard Streams and Error Redirection Study Notes

Stream:
- Stream data ke flow ka logical rasta hai—bilkul pipe ki tarah—jo input ya output ko ek jagah se doosri jagah le jata hai.

- A stream is a logical path through which data flows—like a pipe—carrying input or output from one place to another.

Bash mein command ka output ek raaste ke zariye terminal, file ya kisi doosri command tak jata hai. Is raaste ko stream kehte hain.

Stream koi physical file ya folder nahi hoti. Yeh data bhejne ka logical channel hota hai.

## 1. Introduction

Every Linux command normally works with three standard data streams:

| File Descriptor | Stream | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|
| `0` | `stdin` | Standard input |
| `1` | `stdout` | Standard output |
| `2` | `stderr` | Standard error |

Example:

```bash
cat abc.txt
```

If `abc.txt` does not exist, Bash displays:

```text
cat: abc.txt: No such file or directory
```

This message is sent through **stderr**, not stdout.

---

## 2. Important Concept

`stderr` is **not a folder**.

It is an output stream used by commands to display error messages.

You can redirect stderr into any file or folder you create.

---

## 3. Redirect stdout

Use `>` to send standard output into a file.

```bash
ls > output.log
```

This overwrites the file.

To append output:

```bash
ls >> output.log
```

---

## 4. Redirect stderr

Use `2>` to send error messages into a file.

```bash
cat abc.txt 2> error.log
```

Because `abc.txt` does not exist, the error is saved in `error.log`.

Check it:

```bash
cat error.log
```

Output:

```text
cat: abc.txt: No such file or directory
```

### Append stderr

```bash
cat abc.txt 2>> error.log
```

- `2>` overwrites the file.
- `2>>` appends to the file.

---

## 5. Why This Command Failed

Incorrect command:

```bash
cat abc.txt 2>
```

Error:

```text
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
```

Reason:

`2>` must be followed by a destination filename.

Correct example:

```bash
cat abc.txt 2> error.log
```

---

## 6. Understanding `2>&1`

Command:

```bash
cat abc.txt 2>&1
```

Meaning:

```text
Send stderr to the same destination where stdout is currently going.
```

Since stdout is still connected to the terminal, the error also appears on the terminal.

```text
cat: abc.txt: No such file or directory
```

`2>&1` alone does not automatically create a log file.

---

## 7. Save stdout and stderr in the Same File

Traditional syntax:

```bash
cat abc.txt > combined.log 2>&1
```

Bash shortcut:

```bash
cat abc.txt &> combined.log
```

Both commands save stdout and stderr into `combined.log`.

Check the file:

```bash
cat combined.log
```

---

## 8. Why Nothing Appeared on the Terminal

Command:

```bash
cat abc.txt &> combined.log
```

Nothing appeared because both output streams were redirected:

- stdout went to `combined.log`
- stderr went to `combined.log`

The command still produced an error, but the error was saved instead of displayed.

Check:

```bash
cat combined.log
```

---

## 9. Append stdout and stderr Together

```bash
cat abc.txt &>> combined.log
```

Equivalent form:

```bash
cat abc.txt >> combined.log 2>&1
```

This adds new output to the end of the existing file.

---

## 10. Save stdout and stderr Separately

```bash
command > output.log 2> error.log
```

Example:

```bash
ls create_user.sh abc.txt > output.log 2> error.log
```

Expected result:

`output.log` contains:

```text
create_user.sh
```

`error.log` contains:

```text
ls: cannot access 'abc.txt': No such file or directory
```

---

## 11. Create a Dedicated Logs Folder

```bash
mkdir -p logs
```

Save normal output:

```bash
ls > logs/stdout.log
```

Save errors:

```bash
cat abc.txt 2> logs/stderr.log
```

Save both:

```bash
cat abc.txt &> logs/combined.log
```

Suggested structure:

```text
project/
├── script.sh
└── logs/
    ├── stdout.log
    ├── stderr.log
    └── combined.log
```

---

## 12. Redirection Order Matters

Correct:

```bash
command > output.log 2>&1
```

Processing order:

1. stdout is redirected to `output.log`
2. stderr is redirected to the current stdout destination
3. both streams go to `output.log`

Different behavior:

```bash
command 2>&1 > output.log
```

Processing order:

1. stderr is connected to the terminal
2. stdout is redirected to `output.log`
3. stderr remains on the terminal

Therefore, redirections are processed from left to right.

---

## 13. Discard Error Messages

Use `/dev/null` when you do not want to save or display errors.

```bash
cat abc.txt 2> /dev/null
```

Discard stdout:

```bash
command > /dev/null
```

Discard both stdout and stderr:

```bash
command > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Bash shortcut:

```bash
command &> /dev/null
```

Use this carefully because important errors may be hidden.

---

## 14. Redirect Errors for an Entire Script

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p logs

exec 2>> logs/stderr.log

echo "Script started"

cat abc.txt
ls /wrong-directory

echo "Script finished"
```

After this line:

```bash
exec 2>> logs/stderr.log
```

all later stderr messages are appended to `logs/stderr.log`.

---

## 15. Redirect stdout and stderr for an Entire Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p logs

exec >> logs/stdout.log
exec 2>> logs/stderr.log

echo "Script started"

ls
cat abc.txt

echo "Script finished"
```

Normal output goes to:

```text
logs/stdout.log
```

Errors go to:

```text
logs/stderr.log
```

---

## 16. Add Date and Time to Log Files

```bash
mkdir -p logs

LOG_FILE="logs/error-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').log"

cat abc.txt 2> "$LOG_FILE"
```

Example filename:

```text
logs/error-2026-07-23_05-30-15.log
```

---

## 17. Practical Logging Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOG_DIR="./logs"
STDOUT_LOG="$LOG_DIR/stdout.log"
STDERR_LOG="$LOG_DIR/stderr.log"

mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"

exec >> "$STDOUT_LOG"
exec 2>> "$STDERR_LOG"

echo "[$(date)] Script started"

ls
cat abc.txt

status=$?

echo "[$(date)] Last command exit status: $status"
echo "[$(date)] Script finished"
```

---

| `&>` | Redirect stdout and stderr; overwrite |
| `&>>` | Redirect stdout and stderr; append |

## 20. Interview Questions

### Question 1

What is the file descriptor number for stderr?

**Answer:** `2`

### Question 2

What is the difference between `2>` and `2>>`?

**Answer:**

- `2>` overwrites the destination file.
- `2>>` appends to the destination file.

### Question 3

What does `2>&1` mean?

**Answer:** Redirect stderr to the current destination of stdout.

### Question 4

What does this command do?

```bash
command > output.log 2>&1
```

**Answer:** It saves both stdout and stderr in `output.log`.

### Question 5

Why does redirection order matter?

**Answer:** Bash processes redirections from left to right.

## 21. Final Memory Rule

```text
0 = stdin
1 = stdout
2 = stderr
```

Remember:

```bash
command > output.log 2> error.log
```

means:

```text
Normal output goes to output.log.
Error output goes to error.log.
```
